## 2026-10-23 00:35 Data refresh paused
- Branch `overhaul`: CLAUDE.md (de8525a), ingest fix for `all_matches.csv` doubling (59e917b).
- All 8 Cricsheet zips are downloaded (~42 MB). A rebuild with the fix was in progress and got stopped, so the new DB is unverified. The app still uses the old slim DB.
- Resume: see JOURNEY.md section 6.
- Open questions for Samar:
  1. Competitions: men's T20 only, or add ODI and Test?
  2. Women's T20I: keep as its own competition, or drop?
  3. Stop committing the DB to GitHub LFS (~96 MB per update) and rebuild locally?
  4. Run the overhaul in its own session in this folder?
